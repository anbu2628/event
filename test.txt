<p>W Hotelsâ€™ latest cultural initiative, W PRESENTS, is heading on a multi-destination tour this year. Having already hosted a series of successful live music events in the U.S. last summer, the upcoming global fixture will touch base in Europe and Dubai and will continue to use the hotelâ€™s signature format where, for one night only, its lobbies, courtyards, and outdoor spaces become a stage for local DJs.</p>
